# react-tenderloin
We're creating a simple app to allow iOS &amp; Android users the ability to swipe through different dishes and tell us if youâ€™ve had it before. Users would swipe left if they've never had the dish. Users would swipe right if they've had the dish before. Users can also swipe up to add a comment. The images of the dishes would be provided via API. Each swipe would then submit data to a POST API we'll provide. It is important that this app be developed with React Native because we want to deploy to our student group for testing on either iOS or Android devices.
