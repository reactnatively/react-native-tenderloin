# React Natively

## Tenderloin

We're creating a simple app to allow iOS &amp; Android users the ability to swipe through different quotes and tell us if they have heard it before.
* Users would swipe left if they've never heard of the quote ~~dish~~.
* Users would swipe right if they have heard of the quote ~~dish~~.
* Seperately, users may also choose to add a comment.

The quotes ~~dishes~~ display would be provided via API. Each swipe would then POST data to the API provided.

_PLEASE NOTE: It is important that this app be developed with React Native because we want to deploy to our student group for testing on either iOS or Android devices._
